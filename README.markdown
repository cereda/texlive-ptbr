# TeX Live - Brazilian Portuguese translation

> **Last update:** April 6, 2015

## About

This repository holds the Brazilian Portuguese translation file for [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/).

The translation file `pt_br.po` is now incorporated into the official release in order to provide localized content to the TeX users in the Portuguese-speaking countries.

I must point out that there are some subtle differences between `pt_PT` (European) and `pt_BR` (Brazilian). I tried my best to make the messages at least comprehensible to the European Portuguese speakers.
